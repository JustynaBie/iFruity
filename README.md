iFruity
=======

[Check the running application in this page.](http://justynabie.github.io/iFruity "Check iFruity")

__iFruity__ is the application I have done as my final project in an coding bootcamp.

In this project I focused in:
----------
-  __AJAX__ for the exchange of formation with the backend
- __CSS ILLUSTRATIONS__ to make the fruits and mixer
- __CSS ANIMATIONS__ to give it some movement

All the technologies used are: __HTML5__, __CSS3__, __Javascript__, __jQuery__, __SASS__, __Git__.

To get information about the ingredients Ajax requests are send to the backend which supplies the information in json format.

In __iFruity__ the user can choose among a range of fruits and bases to compose his/her favorite fruit cocktail. Once the fruits are chosen and after mixing them, an information panel is shown with all cocktail nutritional values.

A thank you to Lars Munkholm -[check his work in this page](http://codepen.io/munkholm/pen/twuiD "Lars Munkholm inspirational fruits")-  for his CSS apple, orange, lemon and pear and the inspiration for the rest of the fruits.
