The project iFruity is my final project in coding bootcamp Become Front-End Developer.

The bootcamp was organized by Coder's Lab and took place in Warsaw in March and April 2016.

In this project  I used: HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, JavaScript, Sass, Git. To obtain more infromation about items  Ajax request or requests are send to the database.
All information about items are collected in json file which is used as  database.

The project is responsiv, it works in all lasts versions of browsers: IE, Chrome, Firefix, Opera and mobile devices.

The project consist to make an webpage about fruits and fruits coctails, where it is possible to choose  your favorite fruits to compose your own coctail.  After choosing fruits mixing animation which reminds real fruits mixing is  shown. Then the information panel with all coctail nutritional components  are shown.  It is possible to obtain also information about nutritional components of each  fruit independently.
For make four first  fruits in CSS I based on code http://codepen.io/munkholm/pen/twuiD rest fruits I created purely myself.

You can see my project: http://justynabie.github.io/iFruity.

At this moment ajax requests do not work in GitHub Pages so it is not possible to see mixing effect. I am working on it.
